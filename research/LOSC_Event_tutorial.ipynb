    "\n",
    "A standard metric that LIGO uses to evaluate the sensitivity of our detectors, based on the detector noise ASD, is the BNS range.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is defined as the distance to which a LIGO detector can register a BNS signal with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 8, averaged over source direction and orientation.\n",

    "We take each neutron star in the BNS system to have a mass of 1.4 times the mass of the sun, and negligible spin.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have found from experience (supported by careful calculations) that detector noise produces false signals with SNRs that fall off exponentially; only above an SNR of around 8 is it possible to identify a signal above the detector noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "GWs from BNS mergers are like \"standard sirens\"; we know their amplitude at the source from theoretical calculations. The amplitude falls off like 1/r, so their amplitude at the detectors on Earth tells us how far away they are. This is great, because it is hard, in general, to know the distance to astronomical sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amplitude at the source is computed in the post-Newtonian \"quadrupole approximation\". This is valid for the inspiral phase only, and is approximate at best; there is no simple expression for the post-inspiral (merger and ringdown) phase. So this won't work for high-mass binary black holes like GW150914, which have a lot of signal strength in the post-inspiral phase.\n",

    "## Matched filtering to find the signal\n",
    "\n",
    "Matched filtering is the optimal way to find a known signal buried in stationary, Gaussian noise. It is the standard technique used by the gravitational wave community to find GW signals from compact binary mergers in noisy detector data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some loud signals, it may be possible to see the signal in the whitened data or spectrograms. On the other hand, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals or signals which are of long duration in time may not be visible, even in the whitened data.  LIGO scientists use matched filtering to find such \"hidden\" signals. A matched filter works by compressing the entire signal into one time bin (by convention, the \"end time\" of the waveform).\n",
    "\n",
    "LIGO uses a rather elaborate software suite to match the data against a family of such signal waveforms (\"templates\"), to find the best match. This procedure helps to \"optimally\" separate signals from instrumental noise, and to infer the parameters of the source (masses, spins, sky location, orbit orientation, etc) from the best match templates. \n",
    "\n",
    "A blind search requires us to search over many compact binary merger templates (eg, 250,000) with different masses and spins, as well as over all times in all detectors, and then requiring triggers coincident in time and template between detectors. It's an extremely complex and computationally-intensive \"search pipeline\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we simplify things, using only one template (the one identified in the full search as being a good match to the data). \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that the data around this event is fairly Gaussian and stationary, we'll use this simple method to identify the signal (matching the template) in our 32 second stretch of data. The peak in the SNR vs time is a \"single-detector event trigger\".\n",

    "LIGO data are acquired at 16384 Hz (2^14 Hz). Here, we have been working with data downsampled to 4096 Hz, to save on download time, disk space, and memory requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is entirely sufficient for signals with no frequency content above f_Nyquist = fs/2 = 2048 Hz, such as signals from higher-mass binary black hole systems; the frequency at which the merger begins (at the innermost stable circular orbit) for equal-mass, spinless black holes is roughly 1557 Hz * (2.8/M_tot), where 2.8 solar masses is the total mass of a canonical binary neutron star system. \n",
    "\n",
    "If, however, you are interested in signals with frequency content above 2048 Hz, you need the data sampled at the full rate of 16384 Hz. \n",

    "In the tutorial for GW150914: https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/GW150914/GW150914_tutorial.html\n",
    "we demonstrate how to get the data at the full 16384 Hz sampling rate, do the downsampling, and show how it might limit you if you are interested in frequency content near 2048 Hz and above."
