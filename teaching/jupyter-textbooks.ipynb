    "Jupyter notebooks present the opportunity to reshape how textbooks are delivered in the classroom. Rather than being presented with static pages or PDFs, constructing a textbook using Jupyter notebooks allow the reader to step into each example and tweak and experiment directly with the concepts being taught. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this Bayesian methods book is available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Methods-Hackers-Probabilistic-Addison-Wesley-ebook/dp/B016060UHA/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=) for purchase as a conventional textbook, available on Kindle and Paperback in static versions. However, it is also available as a collection of Jupyter notebooks in its entirety. \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple `git clone` command allows users to import the entire textbook into JupyterHub. This creates a local copy of the exact same textbook, with the exception that it is yours. It can be read just like a normal textbook, but once you want to experiment with its code examples, simple click into the cell and begin modifying its content. \n",
